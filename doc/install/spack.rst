Spack Installation
===================

`Spack <https://spack.io>`_ is a package manager for supercomputers, Linux, and macOS. It makes installing scientific software easy. Spack isnâ€™t tied to a particular language; you can build a software stack in Python or R, link to libraries written in C, C++, or Fortran, and easily swap compilers or target specific microarchitectures.

To install Arbor using Spack, run ``spack install arbor``.
