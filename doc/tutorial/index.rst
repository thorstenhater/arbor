Tutorials
=========

.. Note::
    You can find some examples of full Arbor simulations in the ``python/examples`` directory of the
    `Arbor repository <https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor>`_.

    The examples use ``pandas`` and ``seaborn`` for analysis and plotting which are expected to be
    installed independently from Arbor.

    In an interactive Python interpreter, you can use ``help()`` on any class or function to get its
    documentation. (Try, ``help(arbor.simulation``, for example).

.. Todo::
    Add more in-depth tutorial-like pages building up examples here.
